          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>1990:</strong> The Beginning Our journey began in 1975,
            spearheaded by our grandfather, who initially collected horn bone
            raw materials and sold them. Leveraging his business acumen, he
            started producing handmade horn combs, a popular item at the time.
            Over the next decade, our company sold these combs in large
            quantities, establishing a strong foundation.
            <p>
              <strong>1995: </strong>Innovation With evolving times, our father
              introduced innovative ideas to expand the family business. He
              began purchasing horn bone in large quantities from external
              sources and sold them to smaller suppliers. He invested in new
              machinery, developed new products and designs in handicrafts, and
              built strong relationships with employees, suppliers, and clients.
              Through his hard work and dedication, he transformed our modest
              manufacturing shop into a comprehensive horn bone, wood, resin,
              and metals products manufacturing factory.
